# My Personal Project

## *Workout Tracker and Generator*

For this project, I decided I would make a kind of **workout tracker and generator application**. Essentially, this 
program will be designed to take in basic information about its user such as name, ideal workout schedule and some 
favourite workouts and their respective working weights or PRs. From this, the application will prompt you when you 
begin to plan a workout if you would like to plan your own or have the app choose for you. If the user decides to plan 
their own, they will be given some categories as to what they want to focus on and can choose their exercises from 
there. If the user wants the application to generate a workout, they will still be prompted to choose a category to 
focus on, but from there the app will recommend a random set of workouts in that category, supplying ideal 
working-weights and the PR (if asked for). The targeted audience for this app is generic lifters who are tired of 
planning their workouts every time they go to the gym, those trying to find new exercises to do, or those looking to 
track their progress.

This project is of interest to me mostly because I plan on using it. I think it is a neat way to keep track of your 
progress, especially if you happen to take long breaks in between your gym visits, as most of us had to do recently. I 
also sometimes get quite uncreative when planning my workouts, and this will help me to stop repeating the same ones 
every time I go just because they are the only ones I can remember.
